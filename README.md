  # Etch-A-Sketch.
This is a simple Etch-A-Skecth project from the TOP curriculum. It has a pretty friendly interface and a simple style.
We begin with a 16 x 16 grid as default and 6 buttons on the right.
 ## BUTTONS:
   -Grid Size: Lets you pick the grid size from 2 x 2 up to 100 x 100.
   -Input Color: You click on the box, and a small window will pop up showing different colors, you can choose any of them.
   -Random Color: Every time you click the button, it gives you a random color to paint.
   -Rainbow: When clicked, every time you hover over a box, it paints a different color.
   -Eraser: Erase the painted box color when you hover over them.
   -Clear: clean up the entire grid, returnit it to the default color.
